# CommandLine-Checklist

This is the first big project i did for my CS101. 

Originaly it used to work based on number inputs to create, delete, and modify tasks. I'm currently working on making this project commandLine based. It will definetly make you feel like a Hacker that is organizing his life all from the terminal.

Feautures:

### Create, delete, and modify tasks by using different commands:

 $ create "[name]" 
 
 $ delete "[name]" or [NumberID]
 
 $ modify dateDue "June 3rd 2020" 
 
 $ modify name "[newName]"

 // IT SAVES YOUR PROGRESS
