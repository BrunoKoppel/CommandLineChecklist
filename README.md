# Thareos Command Line Interface

Formely known as Checklist 3000, it began taking shape during my first year of college. In the beginning it used to work based on number inputs to create, delete, and modify tasks. Now, TCLI (Thareos Command Line Interface) is currently under development for those terminal aficionados that would like to try a different way of getting your tasks recorded and done!

Create and delete to dos with terminal commands. What git does for code, TCLI does for todos/tasks!
